# Dashboard Implementation Constraints

## Design Constraints for Final Refactoring

### Icon Replacements
- Replace all icons with colored squares/rectangles
- Replace profile pictures with solid black disks

### Code Constraints
- Avoid using the forbidden tag (interactive clicking element)
- Use `span` instead of the forbidden tag
- Do not add `role` attributes on spans
- These will be refactored at the end stage of the project

### Technology Stack
- Svelte 5 (latest version with runes syntax)
- Pixel-perfect implementation
- Desktop-first (min 1280px width)
- Bonus mobile responsiveness

### Implementation Notes
- Clean, well-structured code with comments
- Proper indentation and organization
- Hover states and micro-interactions where applicable
